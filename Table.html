      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Equality Check </strong></td>
        <td>
          Checks whether the middle element (A[m]) is equal to the target (T) in
          every iteration.
        </td>
        <td>
          Leaves out this check in every iteration, only verifying when L = R.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Number of Iterations </strong></td>
        <td>
          Performs fewer iterations as it stops immediately when the target is
          found.
        </td>
        <td>
          May require one extra iteration on average due to skipping the
          equality check.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Best for General Use</strong></td>
        <td>
          Ideal for most scenarios where a simple and intuitive approach is
          preferred.
        </td>
        <td>Useful when minimizing per-iteration comparisons is crucial.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Performance Optimization</strong></td>
        <td>
          Slightly more comparisons per iteration but usually finishes in fewer
          iterations.
        </td>
        <td>
          Reduces the number of comparisons in each iteration but may take one
          extra step on average.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Readability & Implementation</strong></td>
        <td>
          Easier to understand, widely used, and found in standard libraries.
        </td>
        <td>
          More optimized but slightly harder to grasp due to the delayed
          equality check.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Real-world Usage</strong></td>
        <td>
          Commonly implemented in search functions across programming languages
          and libraries.
        </td>
        <td>
          Used in niche cases where every comparison counts, such as
          high-performance computing.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>When to Use?</strong></td>
        <td>
          Use when clarity, maintainability, and early exit on finding the
          target are priorities.
        </td>
        <td>
          Use when optimizing the number of comparisons is essential, especially
          for large datasets.
        </td>
